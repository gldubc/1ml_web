# 1ML Online REPL

A web-based version of the 1ML compiler and REPL, built using [Andreas Rossbergâ€™s original 1ML implementation](https://github.com/rossberg/1ml) and compiled to JavaScript with js_of_ocaml.

This web interface provides a simple environment for writing and executing 1ML code:

- Write 1ML code in the editor on the left
- Click **"Run"** or press **Ctrl+Enter** to execute.
- View the results in the output panel on the right.
- Use **"Clear"** to reset the output
